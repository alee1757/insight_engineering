The problem was solved by reading in the txt file and storing the required information into a python dictionary.
From there it was written to a new txt file. There have been precautions taken to avoid potential issues with
duplicate entries, changing column orders or names.

You can find the appropriate unit tests in the test folder that consider factors that go wrong such as an extra field in
a row.

No other python packages were used for this project.
